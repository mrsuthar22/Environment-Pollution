The rapidly growing population and economic development are leading to the <b>Environmental Degradation In India</b>through the
uncontrolled growth of urbanisation and industrialization, expansion and massive intensification agriculture, and the destructionof forests.
<p>
It is estimated that the country`s population will increase to about 1.86 billion by the year 2020.The projected population indicates that India
will be the first most populous country in the world and China will be ranking second in the year 2050. India having 18% of the world`s population
on 2.4% of world`s tottal area has greatly increased the pressure on its natural resoures. Water shortages, soil exhuastion and erosion, deforesttation,
air and water pollution afflicts many areas.

India`s water supply and sanitation issues are related to many environmental issues.

Pollution is the introduction of contaminents into an environment that causes instability, disorder, harm or discomfort to the ecosystem<i>i.e</i>
physical systems or living organisms. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances, or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Pollutants, the
elements of pollution, can be foregin substances or energies, or naturally occurring; when naturally occurring, they are considered contaminants when they
excee natural levels. Pollution is often classified as point source or nonpoint source pollution. The Blacksmith Institute issues annually a list of the
world`s worst polluted places. In the 2007 issues the ten top nominees are located in Azerbajian, China, India, Peru, Russia, Ukraine, and Zambia.
