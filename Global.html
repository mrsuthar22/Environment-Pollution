GLOBAL WARMING</h1></FONT>
<FONT face = "Verdana" size = 3>
<p>
Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the Earth`s near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation.
Global surface temperature increased 0.74+-0.18<SUP><FONT size = 3>o</FONT></SUP>C(1.33+-0.32<SUP><FONT size = 3>o</FONT></SUP>F) during the last century. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that most of the observed temperature increase since the middle of the 20th century was caused by
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity such as fossil fuel burning an deforestation. The IPCC also concludes that variations
in natural phenomena such as solar radiation and volcanoes produced most of the warming from pre-industrial times to 1950 and had a small cooling effect afterward.
These basic conclusions have been endorsed by more than 40 scientific societies and academies of science, including all of national academies of science of the major
industrialized countries.<p>
Climate model projections summarized in the latest IPCC report that the global surface temperature will probably rise a further 1.1 to 6.4<SUP><FONT size = 3>o</FONT></SUP>
C uncertainity in this estimate arises from the use of models with differing sensivity  to greenhouse gas concentrations and the use of differing estimates of future 
greenhouse gas emissions. Some other uncertain ties include how harming and related changes will vary from region to region around the globe. Most studies focus on the 
period up to the year 2100. However, warming is expected to continue beyond 2100 even if emissions stop, beacuse of the large heat capacity and the long lifetime of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.<p>
An increase in global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, probably including expansion of subtropical
deserts. The continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice is expected, with warming being strongest in the Arctic. Other likely effects include increase in the
intensity of extreme weather events, species extinctions, and changes in agricultural yields.<p>
Political and public debate continues regarding climate change, and what actions (if any) to take in response . The available options are mitigation to reduce further
emissions ; adaptation to reduce the damage caused by warming; and, more speculatively, geoengineering to reverse global warming. Most national governments have signed and
ratified the Kyoto Protocol aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<p><p><p>

<h3>Temperature Changes</h3><p></A></FONT>
<i>Main Article : Temperature record</i><p>
<CENTER>

value for 2004 is also ploted for reference.</FONT><p></CENTER>
The most commonly discussed measure of global warming is the trend in globally averaged temperature near the Earth`s surface. Expressed as a lineartrend, this temperature rose by
0.74*C +-0.18*C over the period 1906-2005. The rate of warming over the last half of that period was almost double that for the period as a whole (0.13*C +-0.03*C per decade, verses 0.07*C +-0.02*C per decade). 
The urban heat island effect is estimated to account for about 0.002*C of warming per decade since 1900. Temperatures in the lower troposhere have increased between 0.12 and 0.22*C (0.22*C and 0.4*F) per decade
since 1979, according to satellite temperature measurements. Temperature is believed to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally-varying fluctucations such as
the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age.<p>

<h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3><p></FONT>
<i>Main Article : Greenhouse Gas & Greenhouse Effects</i><p>
<CENTER>
<IMG src = "green.jpg"><p>

<p>
The greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in the atmosphere warm a planet`s lower atmosphere and surface. It was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824
and was first investigated quantitively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896. Naturally occuring greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about 33*C (59*F). The major greenhouse gases are water vapour, which  
causes 36-70% of the greenhouse effect ; carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which causes 9-26%; methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), which causes 4-9% [not in citation given] ; and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), which causes 3-7%.
Clouds also effect the radiation balance, but they are composed of liquid water or ice and so are considered separately from water vapour and other gases.<p>
Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO<sub>2</sub>, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFC`s and
nitrous oxide.<p>
The destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbons is sometimes mentioned in relation to global warming. Although there are a few areas of linkage, the relationship between the two is not strong. 
Reduction os stratospheric ozone has a cooling influence, but substantial ozone depletion did not occur until the late 1970`s. Tropospheric ozone contributes to surface warming.<p>

<h3>Environmental</h3><p></FONT>
<i>Main Articles : Effects of Global Warming & Regional effects of global warming</i><p>
<IMG src = "environment.jpg" align = bottom><FONT size = 2>
Sparse records indicate that glaciers have been retreating since the early 1800`s. In the 1950`s measurements began that allow the monitoring of glacial mass balance, reported to the WGMS and the NSIDC.</FONT><p>
It usually is impossible to connect specific weather events to global warming . Instead global warming is expected to cause changes in the overall distribution and intensity of events, such as changes to the 
frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. Broader effects are expected to includeglacial retreat, Arctic shrinkage, and worldwide sea level rise. Some effects on both the natural environment and human life
are, at least in part, already being attributed to global warming.<p>
Additional anticipated effects include sea level rise of 0.18 to 0.59 meters (0.59 to 1.9 ft) in 2090-2100 relative to 1980-1999, new trade routes resulting from arctic shrinkage, possible thermohaline circulation
slowing, increasingly intense (but less frequent) hurricanes and extreme weather events, reductions in the ozone layer, changes in agriculture yields, changes in the range of climate-dependent disease vectors, 
which has been linked to increases in the prevalence of malaria and dengue fever, and ocean oxygen depletion.<p>
Increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increases the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the oceans. CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in the ocean reacts with water to form carbonic acid, resulting in ocean acidification.

<h3>Feedback</h3><p></FONT>
<i>Main Article : Effects of Global Warming</i><p>
The main positive feedback in global warming involves the tendency of warming to increase the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere. The main negative feedback in global warming is the effect of temperature on
emission of infrared radiation : as the temperature of a body increases, the emitted radiation increases with the fourth of its absolute temperature.<p>
<FONT face = "Arial" color = Orange>
<h3>Water Vapour Feedback</h3><p></FONT>
If the atmosphere is warmed, the saturation vapour pressure increases, and the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere will tend to increase. Since water vapour is a greenhouse gas, the increase in water vapour
content makes the atmosphere warm further ; this warming causes the atmosphere to hold still more water vapour (a positive feedback), and so on until other processes stop the feedback loop. The result is a much 
larger greenhouse effect than that due to CO<sub>2</sub> alone. Although this feedback process causes an increase in the absolute moisture content of thr air, the relative humidity stays nearly constant or even 
decreases slightly because the air is warmer.<p>
<FONT face = "Arial color = Orange>
<h3>Cloud Feedback</h3><p></FONT>
Warming is expected to change the distribution and type of clouds. Seen from below, clouds emit infrared radiation back to the surface, and so exert a cooling effect.<p>
<FONT face = "Arial color = Orange>
<h3>Lapse rate</h3><p></FONT>
The atmosphere`s temperature decreases with height in the troposphere. Since emission of infrared radiation varies with tempreature, longwave radiation escaping to space from the relatively cold upper atmosphere 
is less than that emitted toward the ground from the lower atmosphere. Thus, the strength of the greenhouse effect depends on the atmosphere`s rate of temperature decrease with heigth.<p>

<h3>Ice-Albedo Feedback</h3><p></FONT>
<IMG src = "ice.jpg" align = bottom><FONT size = 2>
Aerial photograph showing a section of sea ice. The lighter blue areas are melt ponds and the darkest areas are open water, both have a lower albedo than the white sea ice. The melting ice contributes to the 
ice-albedo feedback.</FONT><p>
When ice melts, land or open water takes its place. Both land and open water are on average less reflective than ice and thus absorb more solar radiation. This causes more warming, which in turn causes more 
melting, and this cycle continues.<p>
<FONT face = "Arial color = Orange>
<h3>Arctic Methane Release</h3><p></FONT>
Warming is also triggering variable for the release of methane in the arctic. Methane released from thawing premafrost such as frozenpeat bogs in Siberia, and from methane clathrate on the sea floor, creates
a positive feedback.<br>
Reduced absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by the oceanic ecosystems.<br>
Ocean ecosystem`s ability to sequester carbon is expected to decline as the oceans warm. This is becuase warming reduces the nutrient levels of the mesopelagic zone (about 200 to 1000 m deep), which limits the 
growth of diatoms in favour of smaller phytoplankton that are poorer biological pumps of carbon.<br>
CO<sub>2</sub> release from oceans.<br>
Cooler water can absorb more CO<sub>2</sub>. As ocean temperature rise some of this CO<sub>2</sub> will be released. This is one of the main reasons why atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is lower during an ice age.
There is a greater mass of CO<sub>2</sub> contained in the oceans than there is in the atmosphere.<br>
Gas release.<br>
Release of gases of biological origin may be affected by global warming, but research into such effects is at an early stage. Some of these gases, such as nitrous oxide released from peat, diectly affect 
climate. Others, such as dimethyl sulfide released from oceans, have indirect effects.<br>
