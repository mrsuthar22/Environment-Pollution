<h3>MAJOR ISSUES</h3><p></A></FONT>
<FONT face = "Verdana" size = 3>
One of the primary causes environmental degradation in a country could be attributed to rapid
growth of population, which adversely affects the natural resources and environment.The three
basic demographic factors of<i>births(natality), deaths (morality)</i>and<i>migration</i>and<i>
immigration</i>(population moving into a country produces higher population). Produce changes in
population size, composition, distribution and these changes raise a number of important questions
of cause and effect.<p>
Population growth and economic development are contributing to many serious environmental calamities
in India. These include heavy pressure on land, land degradation, forests, habitat destruction and
loss of biodiversity. Changing consumption pattern has led to rising demand for energy. The final
outcomes of this are air pollution,global warming,climatic change,water scarity and water pollutio.<p>
Environmental Issues in India include various natural hazards,particularly cyclones and annual monsoon
floods,population growth,increasing individual consumption, industrialization,infrastuctural development,
poor agricultural practices, and resource maldistribution have led to substantial human transformation of
India`s natural environment.<p>

<h3>WATER POLLUTION</h3></A><p></FONT>
<i>Main Article : Water Supply & Sanitation in India</i>
Out of India`s 3,119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full
wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies
directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking,bathing and washing.
This situation is typical of many rivers in India as well as other developing countries.<p>
Open defecation is widespread even in urban areas of India.<p>
More than 400 million people live along the Ganges River. An estimated 2,000,000 persons ritually bathe
daily in the river, which is considered holy by Indians.<p>

To know why 1,000 Indian children die of diarrhoeal sickness every day, take a wary stroll alond the 
Gandes in Varanasi. As it enters the city, Hindusim`s sacred river contains 60,000 fecal coliform
bacteria per 100 millilitres, 120 times more than is considered safe for bathing, Four miles downstream,
with inputs from 24 gushing sewers and 60,000 pilgrim-bathers, the concentration is 3,000 times over the
safety limit, In places, the Ganges becomes black and septic. Corpses, of semi-cremated adults or enshrouded
babies, drift slowly by.<p>

<b> News Week</b> describes Delhi`s sacres Yamuna River as"a putrid ribbon of black sludge"where fecal bacteria
is 10,000 over safety limits despite a 15-year program to address the problem.Cholera epidemics are not unknown.<p>

<h3>AIR POLLUTION</h3></A></FONT>
<p>
Indian cities are polluted by vehicles and industry emissions. Road dust due to vehicles also contributing up to 33%
of air pollution. In cities like Bangalore, around 50% of children suffer from asthma. India has emission standard of
Bharat Stage II (Euro II) for vehicles since 2005.<p>
One of the biggest causese of air pollution in India is from the transport system. Hundreds of millions of old diesel 
engines continously burning away diesel which has anything between 150 to 190 times the amount of sulphur out European diesel
has.<p>
It also appeared that the excessive pollution was having an adverse effect on the Taj Mahal.<p>
Environmental pollution is a global problem and the whole humanity is worried as to how to control it. Each nation is trying its 
best to reduce the polluting factors to save the human life. With the new advanced research analyses, through satellites, man has
been able to find causes of possible depletion of the Ozone Layer and its consequent effects. They talk about pollution through 
excessive refrigeration, fuel burning, industrial pollution and other such factors, but nobody has been able to imagine about the
pollution being caused by the dead bodies  when consigned for cremation in non-scientific manner. We cry about the problem but no
problem can be solved unless you provide an alternate or solution to it. The four identified for pollution namely Air,Water,Earth and
Space, have been well researched and discovered. The visible areas to the human eye-Earth and Water,catch easily the attention but the
other two areas of Air and Space, which are invisible to the common eyesight, are under constant study,vigil and remedial efforts.<p>

<h3>NOISE & LAND POLLUTION</h3></A><p></FONT>
The Supreme Court of India gave a significant verdict on noise pollution in 2005.<p>
Unnecessary honking of vehicles makes for a high decibel level of noise in cities. The use
of loudspeakers for political purposes and by temples and mosques make for noise pollution
in residential areas.<p>
Land Pollution in India is due to pesticides and fertilizers as well as corrosion.<p>

<h3>CONSERVATION</h3></A><p></FONT>
<b><i>Main Article : Wildlife in India</b></i><p>
India, lying within the Indomalaya ecozone, hosts significant biodiversity; it is home to 7.6%
of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.<p>
