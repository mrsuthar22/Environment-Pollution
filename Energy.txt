ENERGY CONSERVATION</h1></FONT>
<FONT face = "Verdana" size = 3><p>
Energy conseravtion is the practice of decreasing the quantity of energy used. It may be achieved through efficient energy use, in which case energy use is decreased
while achieving a similar outcome, or by reduced consumption of energy services. Energy conservation may result in increase  of financial capital, environmental value,
national security, personal security, and human comfort. Individuals and organizations that are direct consumers of enrgy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce
energy costs and promote economic security. Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximise profit.<p>
Electrical energy conservation is an important element of energy policy. Energy conservation reduces the energy consumption and energy demand per capita and thus offsets
some of the growth in energy supply needed to keep up with population growth. This reduces the rise in energy costs, and can reduce the need for new power plants, and 
energy imports. The reduced energy demand can provide more fexibility in choosing the most preffered methods of energy production.<p>
By reducing emissions, energy conservation is an important part of lessening climate change. Energy conservation facilities the replacement of non-renewable resources 
with renewable energy. Energy conservation is often the most economical solution to energy shortages, and is a more environmentally benign alternative to increased 
energy production.<p>

<h3>Energy Conservation by Country<p></FONT>
Bureau of Energy Efficiency is an Indian governmental apex organization created in 2002 responsible for promoting energy efficiency and conservation.<p>

<h3>Japan</h3></FONT><p>
Since the 1973 energy crisis, energy conservation has been a serious issue in Japan. While the Energy Conservation Center promotes energy efficiency in every aspect, 
private entities are implementing the efficient use of energy to industries.<p>

<i>Main Article : Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom</i><p>
Energy conservation in the United Kingdom has been receiving increased attention over recent years. Key factors behind this are the Government`s commitment to
reducing carbon emissions, the projected 'energy gap' in UK electricity generation, and the increasing reliance on imports to meet national energy needs. Domestic
housing and road transport are currently the two biggest problem areas.<p>
The UK Government has jointly funded the Energy Saving Trust to promote energy conservation at a consumer, business and community level since 1993.<p>

<i>Main Article : Energy use and conservation in the United States</i><p>
The United States is currently the largest single consumer of energy. The U.S. Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors :
Transportation, Residential, Commercial, and Industrial.
Energy usage in transportation and residential sectors (about half of U.S. energy consumption) is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers. 
Commercial and industrial energy expenditures are determined by business entitles and other facility managers. National energy policy has a significant
effect on energy usage across all four sectors.<p><p> <A href = "#top">TOP</A>
